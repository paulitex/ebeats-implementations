See ebeats.org for the philosophy behind ebeats.  Here will store as many implementations
as we can develop or find submissions for.  Bonus karma awarded to all contributors, blessings
will flow upon you in accordance with the quality of your contribution.

The spec for ebeats is fairly simple but allows comparisons of key date/time handling aspects of
the different implementations and languages.  The expectation is to output (or return, in cases
where stdout is not applicable, such as SQL functions), the current time in ebeats.

Comments on ebeats or the contests (see rubyists.com for current contests) should be directed
at the [Wiki](https://github.com/rubyists/ebeats-implementations/wiki)
